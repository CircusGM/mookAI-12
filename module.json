  "description": "<p>The mook is characterizied by a lack of ambition: they must be told where to go, what to do, and when to do it. This module automates those decisions on their behalf, freeing you of managing their doomed efforts.</p><p>The scope of this module does not include full automation. It is merely a tool to handle the movement and choices of low-intelligence, low-utility, high-quantity enemies (e.g. goblins, wild animals, barbarians) so that the game master may focus on the Heroes and their true adversaries.</p><p>This module places a button in the combat tracker that, when pressed, finds the token with the current initiative and takes its turn. Rules for taking a turn may be customized from the token's actor's character sheet.</p>",
