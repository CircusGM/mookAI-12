  "description": "<p>The mook is characterizied by a lack of ambition: they must be told where to go, what to do, and when to do it. This module automates those decisions on their behalf, freeing you of managing their doomed efforts.</p><p>The scope of this module does not include full automation. It is merely a tool to handle the movement and choices of low-intelligence, low-utility, high-quantity enemies (e.g. goblins, wild animals, barbarians) so that the game master may focus on the Heroes and their true adversaries.</p><p>This module adds a hotkey ('g') that, when pressed, triggers this automation. The module finds the token with the current initiative, checks its vision for possible targets, chooses one to attack (or explores if there are none), plans a collission-free path, moves the token into range, attacks (auto-rolling and auto-applying damage through MinorQoL dependency), and ends the turn. Mooks will repeat these steps to account for changes in vision and will run until they attack or run out of speed.</p><p>Eventually, rules for taking a turn may be customized from the token's actor's character sheet, but that is not in this build.</p><p>Please read the documentation.</p>",
